rdio-simple for Ruby

An Rdio client including a built-in OAuth implementation.

It's built for Ruby 1.8. Its only dependency is the JSON gem. It probably
works in Ruby 1.9 and other Ruby environments, but that hasn't been tested.

To install the library simply add the om.rb and rdio.rb files to your source
directory.

Usage:
To use the library just load the Rdio class from the rdio module:
  require 'rdio'
Create an Rdio instance passing in an array with your consumer key and secret:
  rdio = Rdio.new(["consumerkey", "consumersecret"])
Make API calls with the call(methodname, params) method:
  rdio.call('get', {'keys'=>'a254895,a104386'})
Authenticate and authorize with the begin_authentication and
complete_authentication methods.

The current token (either request or access) is stored in rdio.token as an
array with the token and token secret.

Examples:
Both examples authenticate and then list the user's playlists. They use
credentials stored in rdio_consumer_credentials.rb.
  examples/command-line.rb
  examples/web-based.rb
NOTE: web-based.rb depends on Sinatra.
